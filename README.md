<!-- 💫 About Me -->
### Hi there, I'm [GyeongMo Yoo](https://bubble-dinghy-f0e.notion.site/Demian-Yoo-d6f30acfe881471890c6cbd06ccbd84c?pvs=4) 👋

<!-- 💫 About Me -->

I am currently studying at **POSTECH** and part of the **Apple Developer Academy @ POSTECH (Cohort 4)**. I focus on **mobile development**, creating experiences that help people focus better and live more meaningfully.

Previously, I studied acting, with a special focus on **human-centered drama therapy**. Later, I pursued **Computer Engineering** at **Keimyung University in Daegu**, blending creativity with technology. [Check out my university](https://www.kmu.ac.kr/uni/main/main.jsp).

I’m also passionate about reflection writing, collaboration, and sharing knowledge on productivity, technology, and app design. When it comes to coding style, I enjoy what I call **Realism Coding** — a philosophy that draws from my background in acting, aiming to translate real human needs into intuitive and effective code.

### 🎭 What is Realism Coding?

In acting theory, **realism** means the actor receives a stimulus, processes it through instinctive impulse, and expresses it with behavior that feels natural and real.

I believe **development is no different.**

Understanding the user’s need (stimulus), channeling it through logical reasoning (impulse), and producing intuitive, effective code (action).

👉 That’s the very approach I call **Realism Coding**, my own philosophy as a developer. 🙈
